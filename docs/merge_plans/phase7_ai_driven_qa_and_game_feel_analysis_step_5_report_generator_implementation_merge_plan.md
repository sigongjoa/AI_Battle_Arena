# Merge Plan for step_5_report_generator_implementation.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), describes "Step 5: Report Generator Implementation." It likely details the design and implementation of a system for generating comprehensive reports based on the QA evaluation results and extracted metrics.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Reporting Requirements:** Identify the types of reports, their content, and target audience.
2.  **Integrate with Reporting Tools:** Incorporate the report generator design into the project's overall reporting strategy and tools.
3.  **Data Visualization:** Define how the data will be visualized in the reports.
4.  **Automation:** Plan for the automation of report generation and distribution.

## Implementation Details
-   **Reporting Frameworks:** Utilize reporting frameworks or libraries (e.g., JasperReports, custom Python scripts with Matplotlib/Seaborn) for report generation.
-   **Templating:** Use templating engines for dynamic report content.
-   **Distribution:** Implement mechanisms for distributing reports (e.g., email, web portal).
