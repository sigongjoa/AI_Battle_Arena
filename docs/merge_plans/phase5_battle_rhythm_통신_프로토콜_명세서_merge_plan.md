# Merge Plan for 통신_프로토콜_명세서.md (Phase 5)

## Summary of Original Document
This document is a communication protocol specification (통신 프로토콜 명세서) for Phase 5, focusing on battle rhythm. It likely defines the communication methods, data formats, and message structures used for interactions related to the battle rhythm system.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Protocol Details:** Identify the communication protocols, data formats, and message structures.
2.  **Consolidate API Documentation:** Integrate these protocol specifications into a comprehensive API documentation for the project.
3.  **Cross-reference with Implementation:** Verify that the implemented communication adheres to these protocol specifications.
4.  **Security Review:** Conduct a security review of the communication protocols.

## Implementation Details
-   **API Design:** Design and implement APIs based on the specified protocols.
-   **Serialization/Deserialization:** Implement robust serialization and deserialization mechanisms for data exchange.
-   **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests for communication protocols.
