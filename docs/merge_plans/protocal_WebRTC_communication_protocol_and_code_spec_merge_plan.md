# Merge Plan for communication_protocol_and_code_spec.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from the WebRTC protocol section, specifies the communication protocol and related code. It likely defines the message formats, communication flows, and code structures for WebRTC interactions.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Protocol and Code Details:** Identify the communication protocols, message structures, and relevant code snippets.
2.  **Consolidate API Documentation:** Integrate these specifications into a comprehensive API documentation for the project.
3.  **Cross-reference with Implementation:** Verify that the implemented code adheres to these specifications.
4.  **Security Review:** Conduct a security review of the communication protocols and their implementation.

## Implementation Details
-   **API Design:** Design and implement APIs based on the specified protocols.
-   **Code Generation:** Explore code generation from protocol definitions (e.g., using Protobuf).
-   **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests for communication protocols and their code implementation.
