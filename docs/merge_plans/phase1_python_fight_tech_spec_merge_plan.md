# Merge Plan for python_fight_tech_spec.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document is a technical specification for the Python fighting game in Phase 1. It likely details the technical architecture, programming languages, libraries, and tools used for the Python-based game.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Technical Stack:** Identify the Python libraries, frameworks, and tools used.
2.  **Consolidate Technical Architecture:** Integrate these technical specifications into the project's overall technical architecture documentation.
3.  **Dependency Management:** Document all Python dependencies and their versions.
4.  **Performance Benchmarking:** Define performance benchmarks for the Python game components.

## Implementation Details
-   **Environment Setup:** Provide clear instructions for setting up the Python development environment.
-   **Code Standards:** Enforce Python coding standards (e.g., PEP 8) using linters.
-   **Testing Frameworks:** Utilize Python testing frameworks (e.g., pytest) for unit and integration tests.
