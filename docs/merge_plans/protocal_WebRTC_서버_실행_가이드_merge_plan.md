# Merge Plan for 서버_실행_가이드.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document is a server execution guide (서버_실행_가이드) for the WebRTC protocol. It likely provides instructions on how to set up, configure, and run the WebRTC signaling server or related backend components.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Consolidate Deployment Instructions:** Integrate these server execution steps into a broader deployment guide for the entire project.
2.  **Automate Deployment:** Explore options to automate the server setup and deployment process (e.g., using Docker, Kubernetes, or CI/CD pipelines).
3.  **Document Dependencies:** Clearly list all prerequisites and dependencies required to run the server.
4.  **Update Troubleshooting:** Add common issues and their resolutions to a troubleshooting guide.

## Implementation Details
-   **Containerization:** Create Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations for the WebRTC server.
-   **CI/CD Pipelines:** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment of the server.
-   **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for the server's health and performance.
