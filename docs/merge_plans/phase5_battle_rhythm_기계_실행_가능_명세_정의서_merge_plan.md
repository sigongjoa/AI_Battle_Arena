# Merge Plan for 기계_실행_가능_명세_정의서.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 5 (battle rhythm), is a machine-executable specification definition (기계 실행 가능 명세 정의서). It likely defines specifications in a format that can be directly executed or validated by machines, possibly for automated testing or code generation.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Executable Specifications:** Identify the machine-executable specifications and their format.
2.  **Integrate into Automated Testing:** Incorporate these specifications into the automated testing framework.
3.  **Code Generation:** If applicable, explore using these specifications for code generation.
4.  **Validation Tools:** Document any tools or frameworks used to validate these specifications.

## Implementation Details
-   **Test Automation Framework:** Integrate with a test automation framework (e.g., Cucumber, Gherkin) to execute these specifications.
-   **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs):** If a DSL is used, ensure its consistency and maintainability.
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate the execution of these specifications into CI/CD pipelines.
