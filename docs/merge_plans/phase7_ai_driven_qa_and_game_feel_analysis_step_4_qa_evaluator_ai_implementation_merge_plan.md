# Merge Plan for step_4_qa_evaluator_ai_implementation.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), describes "Step 4: QA Evaluator AI Implementation." It likely details the design and implementation of an AI system responsible for evaluating game quality and feel based on extracted metrics.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract AI Model Details:** Identify the AI models, algorithms, and training data used for QA evaluation.
2.  **Integrate with AI Strategy:** Incorporate this AI evaluator design into the project's overall AI strategy.
3.  **Evaluation Criteria:** Define the criteria and thresholds used by the AI for evaluating game quality.
4.  **Explainability and Interpretability:** Consider how to make the AI's evaluations explainable and interpretable.

## Implementation Details
-   **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Utilize machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for AI model development.
-   **Training Data Management:** Establish a robust system for managing and versioning training data.
-   **Model Deployment:** Implement a strategy for deploying and monitoring AI models in production.
