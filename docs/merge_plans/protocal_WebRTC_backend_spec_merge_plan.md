# Merge Plan for backend_spec.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from the WebRTC protocol section, is a backend specification. It likely details the design, architecture, and implementation specifics of the backend services supporting the WebRTC communication.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Backend Architecture:** Identify the backend services, their responsibilities, and communication patterns.
2.  **Consolidate API Documentation:** Integrate these backend specifications into a comprehensive API documentation for the project.
3.  **Cross-reference with Implementation:** Verify that the implemented backend services align with these specifications.
4.  **Scalability and Security:** Analyze the scalability and security considerations for the backend.

## Implementation Details
-   **Microservices Architecture:** If applicable, design and implement backend services using a microservices architecture.
-   **API Gateway:** Implement an API gateway for managing and routing API requests.
-   **Database Design:** Design and implement databases to support backend services.
