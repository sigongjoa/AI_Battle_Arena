# Merge Plan for 프로젝트_가이드라인.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document contains project guidelines (프로젝트_가이드라인) for Phase 5, focusing on the battle rhythm. It likely covers coding standards, best practices, development workflows, and other rules to ensure consistency and quality.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Standardize Guidelines:** Review these guidelines and integrate them into a comprehensive project-wide set of development guidelines.
2.  **Identify Phase-Specific Rules:** Distinguish between general project guidelines and those specific to the battle rhythm system.
3.  **Update Developer Onboarding:** Incorporate these guidelines into the onboarding process for new developers.
4.  **Automate Enforcement:** Where possible, automate the enforcement of these guidelines (e.g., via linters, pre-commit hooks).

## Implementation Details
-   **Linter Configuration:** Update linter configurations (e.g., ESLint, Black, Prettier) to reflect coding standards.
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate automated checks for guideline adherence into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
-   **Documentation:** Maintain a central, easily accessible repository for all project guidelines.
