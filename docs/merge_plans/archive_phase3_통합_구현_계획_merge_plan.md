# Merge Plan for 통합_구현_계획.md

## Summary of Original Document
This archived document is an integration implementation plan (통합_구현_계획) for Phase 3. It likely details the strategy, steps, and timeline for integrating various components or systems within this phase.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Integration Strategy:** Identify the overall integration strategy and key integration points.
2.  **Consolidate Integration Documentation:** Combine these integration plans with other integration-related documents to form a comprehensive integration strategy.
3.  **Dependency Mapping:** Clearly map out all dependencies between components during integration.
4.  **Risk Assessment:** Assess potential risks associated with integration and define mitigation strategies.

## Implementation Details
-   **Integration Testing:** Develop a robust integration testing suite to verify successful integration.
