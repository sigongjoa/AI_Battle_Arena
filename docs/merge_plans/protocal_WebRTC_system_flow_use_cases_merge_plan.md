# Merge Plan for system_flow_use_cases.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from the WebRTC protocol section, describes system flow use cases. It likely outlines various scenarios and user interactions within the system, particularly those involving WebRTC communication.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Use Cases:** Identify all system flow use cases and their corresponding steps.
2.  **Consolidate Requirements:** Integrate these use cases into the project's overall requirements documentation.
3.  **Test Case Generation:** Use these use cases as a basis for generating test cases.
4.  **User Story Mapping:** Map these use cases to user stories for development planning.

## Implementation Details
-   **UML Diagrams:** Create or update UML use case diagrams to visually represent the system flows.
-   **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Utilize BDD frameworks to define and test use cases.
-   **Documentation:** Maintain clear and concise documentation of all system use cases.
