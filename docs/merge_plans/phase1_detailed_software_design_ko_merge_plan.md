# Merge Plan for detailed_software_design_ko.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document is a detailed software design document (상세 소프트웨어 설계) for Phase 1. It likely covers the architectural design, module breakdown, data structures, and algorithms for the initial phase of the project.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Design Components:** Identify all major software components, their interfaces, and interactions.
2.  **Consolidate Architecture Documentation:** Integrate these design details into a comprehensive, project-wide software architecture document.
3.  **Cross-reference with Implementation:** Verify that the actual codebase aligns with the detailed design specifications.
4.  **Update Design Patterns:** Ensure that any design patterns or principles outlined here are consistent with the overall project guidelines.

## Implementation Details
-   **UML Diagrams:** Create or update UML diagrams (class, sequence, component) to visually represent the design.
-   **Code Review:** Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to the detailed design.
-   **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation of the software design.
