# Merge Plan for pygame_fight.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document likely describes the implementation or design of a fighting game using Pygame in Phase 1. It could cover game mechanics, rendering, input handling, and other Pygame-specific details.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Game Logic:** Identify the core game logic, mechanics, and rules implemented using Pygame.
2.  **Analyze Pygame-specifics:** Document any Pygame-specific implementations that might need to be abstracted or re-implemented if the project moves to a different engine or framework.
3.  **Consolidate Game Design:** Integrate the game design elements from this document into the overall Game Design Document.
4.  **Performance Considerations:** Note any performance considerations or optimizations related to Pygame.

## Implementation Details
-   **Code Migration:** If transitioning from Pygame, plan for code migration to the new engine/framework.
-   **Abstraction Layer:** Consider creating an abstraction layer for game logic to decouple it from the rendering engine.
-   **Testing:** Develop automated tests for the game logic.
