# Merge Plan for step_1_advanced_simulation_environment.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), describes "Step 1: Advanced Simulation Environment." It likely details the design and implementation of a sophisticated simulation environment for testing and analyzing game feel.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Simulation Features:** Identify the key features, capabilities, and architecture of the advanced simulation environment.
2.  **Integrate into Simulation Strategy:** Incorporate this simulation environment design into the project's overall simulation strategy and documentation.
3.  **Performance Benchmarking:** Define performance benchmarks for the simulation environment.
4.  **Scalability Considerations:** Analyze the scalability of the simulation environment.

## Implementation Details
-   **Simulation Engine:** Implement the simulation environment using appropriate game engines or simulation frameworks.
-   **API for Interaction:** Provide APIs for external systems (e.g., AI agents, QA tools) to interact with the simulation.
-   **Data Generation:** Implement mechanisms for generating diverse simulation data.
