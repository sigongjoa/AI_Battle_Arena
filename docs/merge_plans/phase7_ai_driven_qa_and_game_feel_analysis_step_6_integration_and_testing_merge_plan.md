# Merge Plan for step_6_integration_and_testing.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), describes "Step 6: Integration and Testing." It likely details the strategy, steps, and procedures for integrating all components of the AI-driven QA pipeline and thoroughly testing the entire system.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Integration Strategy:** Identify the overall integration strategy and key integration points for the QA pipeline.
2.  **Integrate into Master Test Plan:** Incorporate the testing strategy into the project's overall master test plan.
3.  **Dependency Mapping:** Clearly map out all dependencies between components during integration.
4.  **Risk Assessment:** Assess potential risks associated with integration and define mitigation strategies.

## Implementation Details
-   **Integration Testing:** Develop a robust integration testing suite to verify successful integration of the QA pipeline components.
-   **End-to-End Testing:** Conduct end-to-end tests to validate the entire AI-driven QA system.
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Automate integration and testing processes within CI/CD pipelines.
