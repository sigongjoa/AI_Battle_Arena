# Merge Plan for frontend_wireframe.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document contains frontend wireframes for Phase 4. It visually represents the layout, structure, and user interface elements of the frontend application for this phase.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Consolidate UI/UX Assets:** Integrate these wireframes into a central repository for all UI/UX design assets (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD).
2.  **Cross-reference with Implementation:** Compare the wireframes with the actual implemented frontend to identify any deviations.
3.  **Update Design System:** If a design system exists, ensure that the wireframes adhere to its principles and components.
4.  **User Feedback Integration:** If user feedback was gathered on these wireframes, document how it was incorporated.

## Implementation Details
-   **Design Tool Integration:** Use design tools to manage and version-control wireframes and other UI/UX assets.
-   **Frontend Development:** Ensure frontend developers have access to the latest wireframes and design specifications.
-   **Component Library:** Develop reusable UI components based on the wireframes and design system.
