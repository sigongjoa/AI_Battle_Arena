# Merge Plan for rl_ai_fighter_design_ko.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document is a design document for the RL AI fighter (강화학습 AI 파이터) in Phase 1. It likely covers the reinforcement learning algorithms, state representation, reward functions, and training methodology for the AI.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract RL Design:** Identify the specific reinforcement learning algorithms, models, and training parameters.
2.  **Consolidate AI Design Document:** Integrate these AI design details into a comprehensive AI Design Document for the project.
3.  **Cross-reference with Implementation:** Verify that the implemented AI models and training processes align with this design.
4.  **Performance Metrics:** Define performance metrics for the AI fighter (e.g., win rate, learning speed).

## Implementation Details
-   **RL Frameworks:** Utilize reinforcement learning frameworks (e.g., Stable Baselines3, Ray RLlib) for AI implementation.
-   **Training Infrastructure:** Set up a robust training infrastructure for AI models.
-   **Evaluation Metrics:** Implement evaluation metrics to track AI performance during and after training.
