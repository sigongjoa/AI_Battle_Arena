# Merge Plan for SWEBOK_갭_분석_및_보완_계획.md (Phase 7)

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), is a SWEBOK gap analysis and remediation plan (SWEBOK 갭 분석 및 보완 계획). It likely identifies areas where the project's software engineering practices deviate from SWEBOK guidelines and proposes plans to address these gaps within the context of AI-driven QA.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Gap Analysis Findings:** Identify the specific gaps identified in the SWEBOK analysis.
2.  **Integrate into Process Improvement Plan:** Incorporate these findings and remediation plans into the project's overall process improvement initiatives.
3.  **Prioritize Remediation:** Prioritize the remediation efforts based on their impact and feasibility.
4.  **Monitor Progress:** Establish a mechanism to monitor the progress of gap remediation.

## Implementation Details
-   **Process Documentation:** Update or create process documentation to align with SWEBOK guidelines.
-   **Training:** Provide training to the development team on improved software engineering practices.
-   **Audits:** Conduct regular audits to ensure adherence to SWEBOK principles.
