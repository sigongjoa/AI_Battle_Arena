# Merge Plan for step_3_metric_extractor_implementation.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), describes "Step 3: Metric Extractor Implementation." It likely details the design and implementation of a system for extracting meaningful metrics from the collected log and telemetry data.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Metric Extraction Logic:** Identify the algorithms and rules for extracting metrics from raw data.
2.  **Integrate with Metric Definition:** Ensure consistency with the metric definition document.
3.  **Data Transformation:** Document any data transformation processes involved in metric extraction.
4.  **Performance Considerations:** Analyze the performance of the metric extraction process.

## Implementation Details
-   **Data Processing Frameworks:** Utilize data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Flink) for metric extraction.
-   **ETL Pipelines:** Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for metric generation.
-   **Validation:** Implement validation checks to ensure the accuracy of extracted metrics.
