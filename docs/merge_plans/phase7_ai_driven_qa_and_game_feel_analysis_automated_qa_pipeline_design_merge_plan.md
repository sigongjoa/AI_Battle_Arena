# Merge Plan for automated_qa_pipeline_design.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), describes the design of an automated QA pipeline. It likely covers the architecture, components, and workflow of the automated quality assurance system.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Pipeline Architecture:** Identify the key components, stages, and data flow of the automated QA pipeline.
2.  **Integrate into QA Strategy:** Incorporate this pipeline design into the project's overall QA strategy and documentation.
3.  **Tooling and Technologies:** Document the tools and technologies used for each stage of the pipeline.
4.  **Performance Metrics:** Define performance metrics for the QA pipeline itself (e.g., execution time, defect detection rate).

## Implementation Details
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate the automated QA pipeline into the CI/CD process.
-   **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for the health and performance of the QA pipeline.
-   **Reporting:** Generate automated reports from the QA pipeline results.
