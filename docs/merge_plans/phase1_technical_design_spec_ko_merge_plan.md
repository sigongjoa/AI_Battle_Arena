# Merge Plan for technical_design_spec_ko.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document is a technical design specification (기술 설계 명세) for Phase 1. It likely provides a high-level overview of the technical architecture, key technologies, and design principles for the initial phase.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Technical Architecture:** Identify the core technical architecture, technologies, and design principles.
2.  **Consolidate Architecture Documentation:** Integrate these technical design specifications into a comprehensive, project-wide software architecture document.
3.  **Cross-reference with Detailed Design:** Ensure consistency between this high-level specification and more detailed design documents.
4.  **Technology Stack Review:** Review the chosen technology stack for scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Implementation Details
-   **Architecture Diagrams:** Create or update architecture diagrams to visually represent the technical design.
-   **Technology Radar:** Maintain a technology radar to track the adoption and evolution of technologies.
-   **Proof of Concepts (POCs):** Conduct POCs for new or unproven technologies.
