# Merge Plan for grpc_testing_plan.md

## Summary of Original Document
This archived document describes the testing plan for gRPC in Phase 3. It likely covers unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing strategies for gRPC services.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Test Cases:** Identify the specific test cases and scenarios for gRPC services.
2.  **Integrate into Master Test Plan:** Incorporate these gRPC test cases into the project's overall master test plan.
3.  **Automate Testing:** Prioritize the automation of gRPC tests.
4.  **Performance Benchmarking:** Define performance benchmarks for gRPC services.

## Implementation Details
-   **Test Frameworks:** Utilize appropriate test frameworks for gRPC (e.g., gRPCurl, custom test clients).
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate gRPC tests into CI/CD pipelines for automated execution.
-   **Reporting:** Generate comprehensive test reports for gRPC services.
