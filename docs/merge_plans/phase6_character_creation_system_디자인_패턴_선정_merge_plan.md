## Summary of Original Document
This document details the selection of design patterns for Phase 6, focusing on the character creation system. It likely explains the rationale behind choosing specific patterns and how they apply to character generation, customization, and management.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Catalog Design Patterns:** Extract and catalog all design patterns mentioned, along with their intended use cases and benefits.
2.  **Cross-reference with Codebase:** Verify if the selected design patterns are actually implemented in the codebase for Phase 6.
3.  **Update Architecture Documentation:** Integrate this information into the overall software architecture documentation, providing a comprehensive view of design choices.
4.  **Knowledge Sharing:** Disseminate this knowledge to the development team to ensure consistent application of patterns.

## Implementation Details
-   **Code Review Guidelines:** Update code review guidelines to include checks for adherence to the documented design patterns.
-   **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):** If not already present, consider creating ADRs for significant design pattern choices.
-   **Training:** Conduct workshops or create internal documentation to educate developers on the chosen patterns.
