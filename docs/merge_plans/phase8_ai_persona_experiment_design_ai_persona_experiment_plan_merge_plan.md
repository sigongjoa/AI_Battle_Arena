# Merge Plan for ai_persona_experiment_plan.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 8 (AI persona experiment design), outlines the plan for conducting experiments with AI personas. It likely covers experiment design, methodology, data collection, and analysis for evaluating different AI personalities.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Experiment Design:** Identify the experiment design, variables, and control groups.
2.  **Integrate into Experimentation Framework:** Incorporate this experiment plan into the project's overall experimentation framework.
3.  **Data Collection Strategy:** Define the data collection strategy for experiment results.
4.  **Statistical Analysis:** Plan for the statistical analysis of experiment data.

## Implementation Details
-   **Experimentation Platform:** Utilize an experimentation platform (e.g., A/B testing tools) for running AI persona experiments.
-   **Data Logging:** Implement robust data logging for experiment data.
-   **Analysis Tools:** Use statistical analysis tools (e.g., R, Python with Pandas/SciPy) for data analysis.
