# Merge Plan for step_2_log_collector_implementation.md

## Summary of Original Document
This document, from Phase 7 (AI-driven QA and game feel analysis), describes "Step 2: Log Collector Implementation." It likely details the design and implementation of a system for collecting logs and telemetry data from the game and simulation environment.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract Log Collection Strategy:** Identify the log sources, data formats, and collection mechanisms.
2.  **Integrate into Data Pipeline:** Incorporate the log collector design into the project's overall data pipeline and logging strategy.
3.  **Data Schema:** Define the schema for collected log data.
4.  **Scalability and Reliability:** Analyze the scalability and reliability of the log collection system.

## Implementation Details
-   **Logging Frameworks:** Utilize robust logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j, Serilog) for in-game logging.
-   **Data Ingestion:** Implement data ingestion pipelines (e.g., Kafka, AWS Kinesis) for collecting logs.
-   **Storage:** Choose appropriate storage solutions (e.g., Elasticsearch, S3) for log data.
