# Merge Plan for grpc_design_details.md

## Summary of Original Document
This archived document provides design details for gRPC implementation in Phase 3. It likely covers service definitions, message structures, and communication patterns using gRPC.

## Merge Plan
1.  **Extract gRPC Definitions:** Identify all gRPC service definitions, message types, and RPC methods.
2.  **Consolidate API Documentation:** Integrate these gRPC details into a comprehensive API documentation for the project.
3.  **Cross-reference with Codebase:** Verify that the implemented gRPC services align with these design details.
4.  **Version Control:** Ensure that gRPC `.proto` files are properly version-controlled.

## Implementation Details
-   **Proto Files:** Maintain `.proto` files in a dedicated directory and use them to generate client and server code.
-   **API Gateway Integration:** If an API gateway is used, ensure proper integration with gRPC services.
-   **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests for gRPC services.
