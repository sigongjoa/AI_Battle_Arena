# Phase 7 Issue Resolution Summary (2025-10-09)

## 1. Problem Description

During the integration and testing phase (Step 6) of the "AI-driven QA and Game Feel Analysis System" (Phase 7), the `test_metric_extractor_conceptual` unit test was failing. This failure manifested in two primary ways:

*   **`jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'StabilityScore'`**: This error occurred when the `ReportGenerator` attempted to render a report, indicating that the `StabilityScore` metric was not available in the data provided to the Jinja2 template.
*   **`MetricExtractor: Could not parse session ID from ...`**: Debugging revealed that the `MetricExtractor` was failing to correctly extract the session ID from log file paths, leading to metrics not being stored in the database. This was the root cause of the `StabilityScore` being undefined.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The primary cause of the `MetricExtractor`'s failure to parse session IDs was an overly restrictive regular expression in the `_parse_session_id_from_filepath` function within `src/metric_extractor/metric_extractor.py`.

*   **Initial Regex:** `r'session_\d{8}_\d{6}_([a-f0-9-]+)\.jsonl\.gz'`
*   **Issue:** The capturing group `([a-f0-9-]+)` was designed to match alphanumeric characters and hyphens. However, the mock session IDs (e.g., `mock_extract_session`) and actual UUIDs generated by the system often contained underscores (`_`). This mismatch caused the regex to fail, resulting in `re.search` returning `None`, and consequently, the session ID could not be extracted.
*   **Secondary Issue:** An `IndexError: no such group` was encountered when attempting to access `match.group(1)` after a temporary simplification of the regex, further indicating issues with the capturing group's definition or the overall regex matching.

## 3. Solution Implemented

To resolve these issues, the following changes were made to `src/metric_extractor/metric_extractor.py`:

1.  **Added `import re`**: The `re` module was imported at the top of the file to support regular expression operations.
2.  **Modified Regular Expression**: The regular expression in the `_parse_session_id_from_filepath` function was updated to be more inclusive, allowing for underscores in the session ID part. The new regex is:
    ```python
    r'session_\d{8}_\d{6}_(.*)\.jsonl\.gz'
    ```
    This broader regex `(.*)` captures any characters for the session ID, effectively resolving the matching issue and the `IndexError`. While less strict, it successfully addresses the immediate parsing problem and allows the tests to pass. A more refined regex could be implemented later if stricter validation of the UUID format is required.

## 4. Verification

After implementing the solution, the unit tests for Phase 7 were re-run using `python -m pytest tests/phase7/`. All 13 tests passed successfully, confirming that:

*   The `MetricExtractor` now correctly parses session IDs from log file paths.
*   Metrics, including `StabilityScore`, are correctly stored in the database.
*   The `ReportGenerator` can now access and utilize these metrics without encountering `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError`.

This resolution unblocks further progress on Phase 7's integration and testing.
