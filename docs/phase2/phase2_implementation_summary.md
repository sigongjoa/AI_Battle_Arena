# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: RL-based AI Fighter Development

This document summarizes the key implementation changes made during Phase 2 of the AI Fighter project, focusing on establishing a robust framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL) based AI fighter development, training, and evaluation. The work involved modifications across both the frontend (TypeScript) and backend (Python) components to support WebRTC-based communication for RL, enhanced reward mechanisms, and improved simulation management.

## 1. Frontend (`arcade-clash/`) Modifications

### 1.1. `arcade-clash/components/RLAgentController.tsx`

*   **Purpose**: This component acts as the bridge between the Python RL environment and the browser-based game. It was modified to handle multi-agent actions and implement the detailed reward calculation logic.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   **Multi-Agent Action Handling**: The `dc.onmessage` handler for `message.type === 'action'` was updated to expect and process actions for both Player 1 (`message.p1Action`) and Player 2 (`message.p2Action`). These actions are then applied to the game engine using `engine.applyExternalAction` for the respective players.
    *   **Reward Calculation Logic**: Comprehensive reward calculation was implemented directly within this component. This includes:
        *   **Damage Dealt/Taken**: Rewards/penalties based on health changes of Player 1 and Player 2.
        *   **Distance Change**: Rewards for Player 1 moving closer to Player 2, and penalties for moving further away.
        *   **Idle Penalty**: A small penalty for Player 1 taking an idle action.
        *   **Win/Loss Rewards**: Significant rewards or penalties upon round termination based on who won.
    *   **Done Condition**: The `done` flag for the RL environment is now correctly set based on `currentGameState.roundOver`.
    *   **State Management**: Previous game state (health, distance) is tracked to calculate changes for reward.

### 1.2. `arcade-clash/src/shared_game_logic/engine.ts`

*   **Purpose**: To allow the game engine to apply actions to a specific player, which is essential for multi-agent control.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   The `applyExternalAction` method was modified to accept two arguments: `targetPlayerId: string` and `action: number`. This enables the `RLAgentController` to direct actions to either Player 1 or Player 2.

## 2. Python Backend (`src/` and `backend/`) Modifications

### 2.1. `src/fighting_env.py`

*   **Purpose**: To adapt the Gymnasium environment to support multi-agent actions and communicate effectively with the updated frontend.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   **Multi-Agent Action Space**: The `action_space` was redefined as `gym.spaces.Tuple((spaces.Discrete(6), spaces.Discrete(6)))`, explicitly indicating that the environment expects a tuple of two discrete actions.
    *   **Multi-Agent Step Method**: The `step` method was updated to accept a `Tuple[int, int]` for the `action` parameter, unpack these into `p1_action` and `p2_action`, and send them to the frontend via the WebRTC action queue.
    *   **Type Hinting**: Imported `Tuple` from the `typing` module to correctly type-hint the `step` method's `action` parameter.

### 2.2. `src/simulation/simulation_manager.py` (New File)

*   **Purpose**: To provide a centralized utility for managing simulation parameters, ensuring reproducibility, and handling logging for RL training.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   Created the `SimulationManager` class with methods for:
        *   `__init__`: Initializes with target FPS and an optional seed.
        *   `set_seed`: Configures random seeds for `numpy` and `random` for reproducibility.
        *   `get_fixed_timestep`: Returns the calculated fixed timestep.
        *   `wait_for_next_frame`: Pauses execution to maintain a consistent FPS.
        *   `start_logging`: Sets up a directory for episode logs.
        *   `log_episode_data`: Appends data for a single episode.
        *   `save_logs`: Saves collected episode data to a JSON file.

### 2.3. `evaluate_agent.py` (New File)

*   **Purpose**: A standalone script for evaluating the performance of trained RL agents.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   Created the script to parse command-line arguments for `model_path`, `num_episodes`, `render` option, `seed`, and `backend_peer_id`.
    *   Implemented the `evaluate_agent` function which:
        *   Initializes `SimulationManager` for seeding.
        *   Creates a `FightingEnv` instance.
        *   Loads a trained `PPO` model.
        *   Runs the agent for a specified number of episodes, collecting rewards, episode lengths, and win rates.
        *   Prints a summary of evaluation results (mean reward, win rate, etc.).
        *   Handles rendering if specified.

### 2.4. `train_rl_agent.py`

*   **Purpose**: To orchestrate the RL training process, integrating the new `SimulationManager` and `EvalCallback` for robust training and evaluation.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   **Simulation Management**: Integrated `SimulationManager` to set the random seed for the training run and manage logging directories.
    *   **In-Training Evaluation**: Implemented `EvalCallback` from `stable_baselines3.common.callbacks`. This callback:
        *   Periodically evaluates the agent in a separate `eval_env`.
        *   Logs evaluation metrics to TensorBoard.
        *   Saves the best-performing model during training.
    *   **Environment Setup**: Ensured `FightingEnv` is instantiated with `backend_peer_id` and wrapped with `Monitor` for proper logging with `EvalCallback`.
    *   **Argument Parsing**: Added command-line arguments for `total_timesteps`, `seed`, and `backend_peer_id`.

### 2.5. `src/metric_extractor/metric_extractor.py`

*   **Purpose**: To ensure type hinting compatibility with Python 3.9.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   Replaced `str | None` type hints with `Optional[str]` and added `from typing import Optional` import.

### 2.6. `src/collision_manager.py`

*   **Purpose**: To fix a `SyntaxError` in an import statement.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   Corrected the import line `from typing import Tuplefrom src.player import Player` to `from typing import Tuple\nfrom src.player import Player`.

### 2.7. `backend/core/game_runner.py`

*   **Purpose**: To remove gRPC-related code as per user instruction, resolving previous `ImportError` and simplifying the component.
*   **Changes Made**:
    *   Removed the import statement `from .. import game_pb2`.
    *   Removed all code related to creating `game_pb2.PlayerState` and `game_pb2.GameState` protobuf messages.
    *   Removed the `yield game_state_pb` statement, effectively disabling gRPC streaming from this component.
    *   Updated the class docstring to reflect the removal of gRPC streaming functionality.

This comprehensive set of changes lays the groundwork for multi-agent reinforcement learning within the project, enabling training, evaluation, and robust simulation management.

## Additional Notes: Pytest Execution

It is necessary to run `pytest` to verify the Python backend implementation. Ensure `PYTHONPATH=.` is set when running `pytest` from the project root to correctly resolve module imports.
